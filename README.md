# *Animal Classifier app using Pytorch  framework *

# Instructios to run this 
    * Install Anaconda
    * Create a conda environment
    * Install pyrorch CPU or GPU version from https://pytorch.org/
    * Run main.py
    * Do not run train if you dont have a GPU for training
    * Extract and move contents from data.zip to data folder
    * Download Animal_Classifier_80-10-10.pth and remane it to Animal_Classifier.pth then move it to Model_Save folder

# Note
    * For Training testing and Inference you need data.zip and conda environment with Dependencies from requirements.txt
    * For Inference only you need  Animal_Classifier_80-10-10.pth and conda environment ith Dependencies from requirements.txt

* ## Contain a full DL structure from training to testing to inference
* The codes are created in a modular manner which helps if you want to create a new project
* Created based on plug and play modules

* ## Available animals are dog, horse, elephant, butterfly, chicken, cat, cow, sheep, spider, squirrel
* Used dataset is Animals-10 clasification dataset from kaggle
* Dataset link https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10/notebooks
* The Dataset from Kaggle has been altered to satisfy the needs of thsis project 

* If you have suggestion to improve the code feel free to let me know
* If you like the project please prove a '*' to this repo

# Downloads
* Augumented Dataset https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_5m9TTmr3NeClO75MtPzVixeShG1Qp2_/view?usp=sharing
* Model trained by me if you want to test any images in the listed 10 classes https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kXXzu_biwAQRnRmw9PSq9qLrucD9wvDS/view?usp=sharing

# Current build issues

* Train and test function only works on Linux Machines for now (if you found it working on a Windows machine please let me know)
